    "description": "SPOT is designed to efficiently cover huge areas in record time, making it a perfect choice for cartography and monitoring applications. The SPOT satellites build upon a legacy of data that began 30 years ago with the launch of the original SPOT 1 satellite in 1986. This legacy means that today, users have access to a vast archive of high-resolution imagery collected over the past decade, spanning billions of km² and offering unique historical insights. Every day SPOT acquires 3 million km² of imagery with 1.5 m panchromatic and 6 m multispectral bands.",
